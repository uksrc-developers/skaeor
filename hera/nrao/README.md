# NRAO tests

Before transferring data to UKSRC resources, tests were run on the NRAO system to verify the python environment.  These tests are described in the following subsections.

## Run the jupyter notebook

In this test, JB ran HERA's [H1C IDR3 power spectrum notebook](https://github.com/HERA-Team/H1C_IDR3_Power_Spectra/blob/main/SPOILERS/All_Epochs_Power_Spectra/H1C_IDR3_Power_Spectra.ipynb) on the full power spectrum dataset generated by HERA.  The output files from `hera_pspec` for the H1C IDR3 analysis are available on NRAO and do not need to be copied from cold storage.  The notebook run on NRAO for this test is stored in `H1C_IDR3_Power_Spectra.ipynb` in this directory.  This test verifies that the python environment has all of the dependencies required to form the final one-dimensional power spectrum estimate.

## Run `hera_pspec`

In this test, JB ran `hera_pspec` on a subset of the full dataset used by HERA to ensure the python environment can run `hera_pspec` and generate the files that get fed into the notebook.  JB used a subset of the full HERA data for this test so the test would run more quickly.  For this test the three files of interest in this directory are

    - `pspec_params_LPXLTK.yaml`: yaml file containing file paths and analysis parameters for `hera_pspec`
    - `pspec_pipe.py`: python file which reads in the parameters in `pspec_params_LPXLTK.yaml` and runs `hera_pspec`
    - `run_pspec_LPXLTK.sh`: slurm sbatch script which calls `pspec_pipe.py`
