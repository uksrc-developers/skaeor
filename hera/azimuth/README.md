# Azimuth tests

This directory documents the tests run on Azimuth of the `hera_pspec` pipeline.  This testing is divided into two subdirectories:

- `subset/`: testing using a subset of the full H1C IDR3 dataset to verify the python environment
-  `full/`: testing using the full H1C IDR3 dataset

Please see the READMEs in each subdirectory for more information.
